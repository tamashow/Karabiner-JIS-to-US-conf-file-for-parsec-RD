# Karabiner-JIS-to-US-conf-file-for-parsec-RD
made for using parsec remote desktop from a JIS keyboard - macbook Air to a windows pc with US keyboard.
It will fix problems of missmatch of the symbols from printed on the JIS keyboard.

Usage:
1. Go "Complex modifications"
2. Add your own rule
3. copy and paste the code in conf.json
4. save it

PS.
I also recommand remapping 英数-かなkeys to some combinations of modifier keys and map it to IME OFF-ON with PowerToys.
